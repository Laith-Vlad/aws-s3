## Project Description

- firstly i wrote my function using vs code then uploaded it to lymbda 
- secondly created a bucket called supers33 and added some pics then whatched how data will look so i can find dynamically the name of the image.
- thirdly i put 3 cases empty where nithing happens empty and we add a pic and we have a pic with the same name where we update it.
- i added a code in the permisoon policy to stop giving premmesion every time 
- in lambda i put that it should take 2 trigers png and jpg 
- in the end it worked seamlessly and will as it is supposed to do.
### Testing:

 i have tested it by trying diffrent end point like png jpg  and by adding the same picture name to see if it will replace it or not.
